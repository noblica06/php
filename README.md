#App deployed using xampp

If you are using XAMPP all you need to do is move this apps source folder into the htdocs folder in the XAMPP directory.

The second step is you need to open the database.php file located in the app/core folder and edit the parameters for the database connection.

#Important!
Make sure your user you put in has the permission to alter the database!
